Or: Hey
Colin: how are you?
Or: I'm great, how are you?
Colin: Good.
Colin: How are things going?
Colin: How you
Or: been actually very good.
Or: You're gonna see it a bit but very good
Colin: guys are coming along
Or: yeah everything is working and uh it's just becoming to be you know one beautiful thing so we enjoy it.
Or: Yeah.
Or: Yeah.
Colin: How many employees do you guys have now?
Or: Uh 15 but just 99 of them for full time employees?
Colin: Okay
Or: cool.
Or: Yeah.
Or: Uh Yeah mainly now you know divided between R.
Or: And D.
Or: And sales.
Or: Yeah and just building it uh we're gonna say very quickly very direct into the competitors eyes.
Or: So it's a very interesting yeah.
Or: How are you?
Colin: Yeah we're good man, we're just cranking along, you know it's uh I'm sure you can appreciate, you know with the market here in the US and I mean it's more global but our tam and R.
Colin: I.
Colin: C.
Colin: P.
Colin: You know they've they've made purchasing software a lot more difficult the second half of this year.
Colin: So we're still grinding, we're still bringing on really cool customers.
Colin: Um Just not at the velocity that a normal market condition would probably represent.
Colin: So we're just trying to get through it with hoping next year things open up a bit
Or: for sure.
Or: It's interesting to see that is like a cross size, it's not just the little ones, it's also very big ones that actually changed the way that you're buying because this is changed from the other period.
Or: It was trouble now you can see that even the gigantic you know company going down this this is interesting.
Or: Yeah, sure.
Or: Cool.
Or: I'm hearing about a lot of success.
Or: So
Colin: yeah, we're growing.
Colin: I mean, you know, the customers that we're going live with are seeing really good results.
Colin: So it's validating our hypothesis building on a lot of additional value propositions and yeah, I hired a couple of new sales folks.
Colin: So we're trying to, we're trying to move the ball down the field, so to
Or: speak.
Or: Cool, very cool.
Or: Um, so I just connected to you because I saw something very special and it's like a notification that one of our oldest version just came alive and we just like what a fun like what happened over here and then it's you recording, it's just, you know, work me up and say, okay, let's just give you a grand tour on the new platform and see if it's something you can, you can use and you can enjoy.
Or: Uh, as, as you said, it's just, you know, starting to, you know, recruit more people to your team.
Or: I think this is the best way to actually, you know.
Or: Yeah.
Or: So let's just share my screen.
Or: Can you see?
Or: Yeah,
Colin: it was, it was frozen for a second there.
Colin: But
Or: yeah, okay.
Or: Just making a lawyer.
Or: So I can see you.
Or: Amazing.
Or: So the platform is here you is, you are here.
Or: Okay.
Or: It's just the, you don't know amazing what you can see already.
Or: It's already looked changed.
Or: Of course it's the new UI everything is sleeker, but this is not that, let's say the kicker.
Or: So you have a lot of stuff that is actually changed with the version that you know.
Or: So first of all it's all the, you know, the search.
Or: So you can use the search to look for specific people specific subject specific part of the transcription and you can divide it of course by your meeting or everyone meetings.
Or: So it's just, you know, get to your space.
Or: We're now working with zoom meats and things and integrated into the calendars.
Or: So it's a bit different process if we talked back then and we talked about the ability to actually just, you know, enter the recording of the zoom.
Or: So now what we're doing is, you know, the other participants that you can see down there.
Or: So we have no mercy, no daycare with us on the coal.
Or: So how we're working is very easy.
Or: So we integrated into a calendar, remind me you're working with physics five when you're working with google, google.
Or: So we integrated and then just scraping your entire meetings, find out where you have a specific visual interaction.
Or: So if we're talking again zoom meetings and just kicks in as another participant, you can change the name of this participant to whatever you like.
Or: So it can be as pc as uh maybe it's not pc as you know, just calling it as well, calling it man and then say this is my camera.
Or: So this is yours.
Or: Of course you need to ask for permission to record a call but it's uh in your hand.
Or: Um Then the note taker is joining the conversation.
Or: This is the recorder.
Or: So they can see it always like recording.
Or: It's just you know, something that you're missing.
Or: Uh After one and then after the call ended same processes was just you know, jumping into the analysis, analyze everything and then bring you back some information, the information that you can get.
Or: Let's just jump ah email.
Or: Never mind.
Or: Let's just changes something.
Or: Uh This is a conversation I had yesterday uh on something interesting.
Or: Okay so I'm gonna show you.
Or: Yeah.
Or: Yeah.
Or: Cool.
Or: So this is a conversation between five people.
Or: Yeah.
Or: The stuff that you can get today and the stuff that you didn't have back then is first of all all that transcription notes are still here.
Or: Now you can also have questions.
Or: All the questions that were asked during the conversation is collected.
Or: And now you can see when someone asked a question and what time and you can see the homes of interest which means you can build your own tributes.
Or: So if someone talked about, I don't know, let's just build it like settings Cavalleri and then get big big no no group.
Or: Okay now we can edit into it something like I don't know whenever someone is talking about uh Apple.
Or: Yeah.
Or: So the new feature of Apple, I want to know about it.
Or: I want to know how people felt about it and I want to know anything and then just drop you a pin conversation and say this is when you talked about so how it looks actually it looks like okay, so this is uh it's gonna look like this and then you can just click on showing timeline and you can see the specific spots when you talk about in this case.
Or: Next steps, if you click it, you can see the specific words that triggered it.
Or: Okay.
Or: And of course if you click the specific square, you can jump onto the specific moment and here the staff that people said.
Or: Okay, additionally you have the questions so you have golden questions.
Or: Golden question is the case when someone asks something that involved a trigger word.
Or: Okay, so in this case, how much they are paying its pricing.
Or: Uh, here is a word with the filler.
Or: I'm tracing my feelers started working on it so it has some filler um peter you can have the insights.
Or: Okay, the talk ratio, the patients of your seller uh team questions, how many questions did you ask as a team average monologue, longest monologue.
Or: Everything is already inside it.
Or: So you can gain all the information about how engaged was your seller.
Or: If they just pitch ask questions, What create snippets, you can create specific snippets on a specific point of the conversation tell this is um, I don't know, amazing pitch, great note uh bravo, you can write whatever you like, of course the specific event specific whatever.
Or: When you click share two things happen.
Or: First thing you can share the specific snippet, it's already uh copied into your clipboard and then when you click it it's gonna look like this and you have the notes, so you can see the stuff that you wrote before the second stuff is already implemented into your knowledge base.
Or: So you have all the knowledge base, the stuff that you want to share if you want to talk with someone, if you want to, you know, train someone board someone just to do a best ramp up.
Or: You can just capture the specific moment that you want people to learn from and then they can see it, they can learn from it, you can capture a whole conversation whatever you like.
Or: Um Cool, just thinking about the the changes between them and now and in the recording session here in the setting recording box, you can just choose the entire settings.
Or: So this is the name of the box.
Or: If I wanted to join every call, automatically join, just join.
Or: Also internal calls, join recurring calls, joining known host meetings.
Or: So you asked me back then if you can join conversation that you're not the host and now you can okay for every conversation that someone invited you, The board will join if you want to kick it, you need to kick it within the platform.
Or: Why?
Or: Because you know the host so you cannot control other participants so how it's looks you're going into upcoming you can see all the meetings that you have and in this place you can see in progress if you click the red button yes stop it will keep the bus.
Or: Okay
Colin: got it
Or: cool.
Or: Sorry for the future dump again just you know platform already I just need to ramp you up integration.
Or: So I said calendar and outlook crm integrated with your crm now hubspot, Salesforce pipe drive and soho Okay you use one of those
Colin: Salesforce?
Colin: Yeah
Or: Salesforce give your person so supposed to be A.
Or: S.
Or: A.
Or: P.
Or: Ne.
Or: Nobody uses a it's fine.
Or: Sure
Colin: unless you're like a B.
Colin: Two B.
Colin: Manufacturer you don't use.
Or: Uh So of course if you integrate it into your cell phones it's very basic integration.
Or: So we create the account in case there was an account.
Or: So we're creating the account and adding a meeting log with the meeting link.
Or: So you have the U.
Or: R.
Or: L.
Or: Already in your crm.
Or: And then you can see all the information from their force, the vocabulary measures.
Or: We talked about it.
Or: The meeting types similar to what you have back then according to what we talked about it.
Or: That's it.
Or: Okay of course you can use it in many different ways.
Or: You can find out all the uh from uh the bars so you have the green dots of course positive reactions, red dots, negative reactions, question marks, question asked and the gray line is the top time.
Or: Okay here you have the token ratio, you can skip a specific participant and just listen to the entire, you know, other folks, If you want to listen in that speed, whatever, you know, you know one
Colin: thing um because I am going back, I completely uh
Or: I
Colin: forgot that we had this going.
Colin: So the first time we recorded a call in a while for one of my new hires, I saw you know the email come up saying like that it was complete with the analysis and
Or: how
Colin: do you guys, how do you guys calculate the score?
Or: So yeah, sure.
Or: This court is invited into a couple of stuff.
Or: First of all the amount of positive against negative.
Or: Uh we divided it by the participant count.
Or: So each participant can drive, you know, let's say in this case period of the score, Then you can reach 100% of the score for each participant and then gain 100 and we're looking for uh all the next steps.
Or: So we're looking into the next steps and see if you had, you know, everything in line And probably this is, it's just something very, very light.
Or: Now the cases, it's not supposed to be, let's say spot on in the case of this is the best goal you have to add, but it's a benchmark.
Or: So all your scores are 80 and you have a score of 60 then you need to check this girl out.
Or: This is the place like it's better to transfer it to traffic light or something when we think about it and not say score, but this is the case.
Colin: Yeah,
Or: yeah.
Or: Cool.
Or: One more thing.
Or: So we talked about creative sleeper, but you have a video sharing.
Or: So if you recorded the call, some people when you're saying that you're recording a call is asking for the conversation itself.
Or: So you can just video sharing and then you just send them the link.
Or: It's important to say it's just a link without the notes without disease without anything.
Or: So then they can, if they want just right click save video as this link is available for seven days.
Or: So if you're just sending the link after seven days disappears and then they will talk with you again.
Or: This is cool, this is a good, you know, for sale to have people to actually come back, yep.
Or: Cool.
Or: Yeah, progress Yeah.
Colin: Now do you have any sort of as like more from a managerial point of view, um any dashboards to like
Or: see
Colin: the reps, calls and stuff like that and the scores against the calls and all that
Or: stuff?
Or: Yeah, so we're creating it right now in the next couple of months is going to be fully loaded.
Or: So we're talking about transfer it in a different perspective.
Or: So we've, you know we talked about the usual like sub this is the amount of call, this is the and this is the right order to do this.
Or: What we're adding is actually taking the topics out of the conversations and then tell you listen whenever your rap rap acts let's call it.
Or: He's talking about delivering 33% more fear than his colleagues and then you have by specific topic uh you know the performance of each participant each center and then you can actually work with them to to improve them and not just you know to measure them by by conversion but actually talking about okay you're very bad talking about competition.
Or: Let's work it, let's work it and then just you know translate to the knowledge base.
Or: Start to learn.
Or: I want to see progress in two weeks.
Or: Yeah.
Or: Cool.
Or: Yeah
Colin: um awesome.
Colin: Um Sorry are you open to us trying this newer version for a little bit?
Colin: Um
Or: Yes so what we're doing usually when we're talking about a pilot so we're transferring a contract.
Or: The contract is for a year with the amount of users that you think you're going to use the platform in the pilot and then I'm adding a term of termination for convenience for 30 days and then you can just you know drop out whatever you like if you didn't like it and if not you just continue to use it.
Colin: Okay.
Colin: Um Yes and send that over to me and I'll take a look.
Colin: We're all we're all actually Tall and door and really in the team um in Israel they're all coming over to New York City next week um and we're gonna do a bunch of 2023 planning so if you get that pilot contract over I can take a look and then share it with the team and we can make a decision
Or: on it or not.
Or: Amazing so I'll do it, I'm also gonna send you this conversation so you can see the results and also all the new stuff so if you want to talk with it you can just open the conversation and show them and and just let me know how many people do you think you're gonna gonna use this platform?
Colin: uh there's probably gonna be uh 4: 5
Or: people.
Or: Okay so I sent the 45.
Or: Okay.
Or: Amazing cool man so thank you very yeah the big power in new york Yeah
